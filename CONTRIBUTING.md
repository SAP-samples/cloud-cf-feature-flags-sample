## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, create a pull request.
Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) on submitting their first pull to this project.
This DCO acceptance can be done in the PR itself - look out for the CLA assistant that will guide you through the simple process.
SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
