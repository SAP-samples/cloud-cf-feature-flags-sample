# Feature Flags Service Demo Application

## Description

Feature Flags service Demo Application is a simple Spring Boot application that consumes the [Feature Flags service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2250efa12769480299a1acd282b615cf/Cloud/en-US) on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. It implements a [feature toggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle) (evaluation call to the Feature Flags service) and exposes this feature toggle through a Web user interface. There is also one REST end-point that reads the value of `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.

## Requirements

* You have set up [Maven 3.0.x](http://maven.apache.org/install.html).
* You have an [SAP BTP enterprise (productive) account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-started-with-enterprise-account-in-cloud-foundry-environment) on Cloud Foundry environment. 

  ðŸ’¡**NOTE:** You can also use a [trial account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-started-with-trial-account-in-cloud-foundry-environment) but some functionalities won't be available for you.
* You have a space on a Cloud Foundry instance - [productive](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/create-spaces) or [trial](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/cf-env-setting-up-your-trial-account#create-your-trial-space).
* You have set up the [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) plug-in for `cmd`.
* You have installed [cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).

## Running the Application on SAP BTP

ðŸ’¡**NOTE:** This guide uses the **eu20** region (https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit#). 

> To use a different SAP BTP region, you need to modify the domain in the requests. See: [Cloud Foundry Regions and API Endpoints](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html)

<!-- tocstop -->

### 1. Build the feature-flags-demo Application

Run the following commands, consequently:

    $ git clone git@github.com:SAP/cloud-cf-feature-flags-sample.git
    $ cd cloud-cf-feature-flags-sample
    $ mvn clean install

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can use the Eclipse IDE. Choose the `clean install` goal from the _Run As > Maven Build..._ menu.

### 2. Edit application name in manifest file

It's quite possible that someone else has already deployed the `Feature Flags Demo Application` with the name **feature-flags-demo** (as it is currently set in the `manifest.yml` file). 
Cloud Foundry does not allow two applications with the same name to be deployed in the same region! Therefore, we **highly recommend** that you change the application name in the `manifest.yml` file before deploying. For example:

    ---
    applications:
    - name: feature-flags-demo123
      path: target/feature-flags-demo.jar

ðŸ’¡**NOTE:** Use the modified value in all commands that require application name, as well as when requesting the application in a browser or via `curl`.

### 3. Deploy feature-flags-demo on SAP BTP

 1. Log in to your Cloud Foundry landscape. (The `eu20` region is just an example.) Run:

    ```
    $ cf login -a https://api.cf.eu20.hana.ondemand.com
    ```

2. Choose your subaccount (org) and space.

3. Deploy the application. Run:

    ```
    $ cf push
    ```

### 4. Create a Service Instance of Feature Flags service

#### 4.1 Ensure the feature-flags service exists in the Service Marketplace

Run the following command:   
  ```
  $ cf marketplace
  ```  
Result:


    -----
    Getting services from marketplace in org <ORG_ID> / space <SPACE> as <USER_ID>...
    OK
    service          	plans    	description
    ...
    feature-flags    	lite, standard     	Feature Flags service for controlling feature rollout
    ...

**NOTE:**  If you're using a trial account, the only available service plan will be `lite`.

#### 4.2 Create a Service Instance of Feature Flags

* For a productive account, run:
  
    ```
    $ cf create-service feature-flags standard feature-flags-instance
    ```

* For a trial account, run:

    ```
    $ cf create-service feature-flags lite feature-flags-instance
    ```


**Note:** Alternatively, you can use the SAP BTP cockpit. See [Create a Service Instance](https://help.sap.com/docs/feature-flags-service/sap-feature-flags-service/initial-setup#loioc7b30b5bf54149148d2302617917dc3e).


### 5. Call the feature-flags-demo Application's /vcap_services End-Point

> **Note**: Expect to receive an empty JSON code - {}.

The `/vcap_services` end-point simply returns the content of the _VCAP_SERVICES_ environment variable. As for now, there is no service instance bound to `feature-flags-demo`, thus you receive an empty JSON.

In the command you use the following URL: `\<application_URL\>/vcap_services`. 

To find the value of `\<application_URL\>`, go to the SAP BTP cockpit > **feature-flag-demo** > **Overview** > **Application Routes**.

To call the application, run (for example):

    $ curl https://feature-flags-demo.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com/vcap_services

### 6. Bind feature-flags-demo to feature-flags-instance

    $ cf bind-service feature-flags-demo feature-flags-instance

    -----
    Binding service feature-flags-instance to app feature-flags-demo in org <ORG_ID> / space <SPACE> as <USER_ID>...
    OK
    TIP: Use 'cf restage feature-flags-demo' to ensure your env variable changes take effect

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can use the SAP BTP cockpit. See [Bind Your Application to the SAP Feature Flags Service Instance](https://help.sap.com/docs/feature-flags-service/sap-feature-flags-service/initial-setup#loioe7ef0ce6d4b14ae387de5bb18549c250).

### 7. Restage feature-flags-demo

Restage `feature-flags-demo` application so the changes in the application environment take effect.

    $ cf restage feature-flags-demo

### 8. Ensure that feature-flags-instance is bound to feature-flags-demo

> **Note**: Expect to receive the injected environment variables by the Feature Flags service.

    $ curl https://feature-flags-demo.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/vcap_services


Sample JSON response:
```json
{
  "feature-flags": [
    {
      "credentials": {
        "x509": {
          "certificate": "...",
          "key": "...",

          "...": "..."
        },
        "password": "aa_12345678XYZZZZZ000mnopRE+qs0e=",
        "uri": "https://feature-flags.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com",
        "username": "sbss_x234osj//pmabsuskr6nshmb2arw6dld4hfb3cj4m2bonkqmm3ts6c68mdpzxz2fma="
      },
      "syslog_drain_url": null,
      "volume_mounts": [ ],
      "label": "feature-flags",
      "provider": null,
      "plan": "standard",
      "name": "feature-flags-instance",
      "tags": [
        "feature-flags"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Accessing the Demo Application

The web interface of the demo application will be accessed multiple times throughout this tutorial. Here is how to open it: 

1. Go to the SAP BTP cockpit.
2. Navigate to the `feature-flags-demo` application overview.
3. Open the link from the **Application Routes** section. For example: `https://feature-flags-demo-happy-bear.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com`
